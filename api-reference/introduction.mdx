## Introduction

Welcome to the Iris AI Testing API documentation. Our API is built using [tRPC](https://trpc.io), providing end-to-end typesafe APIs with great developer experience.

<Note>
  A TypeScript SDK is coming soon to make integration even easier! Stay tuned for updates.
</Note>

## API Structure

All our API endpoints follow a consistent tRPC-based structure:

```bash
https://app.tryiris.dev/api/trpc/[router].[procedure]
```

For example:
- `test.create` - Create a new test
- `agent.delete` - Delete an AI agent
- `project.update` - Update project details

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your Iris API token. Include it as a header in your requests:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Headers
IRIS_ACCESS_TOKEN: <your-iris-token>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  You can obtain your API token from the Iris dashboard under Settings > API Keys.
</Note>

## Request/Response Format

Due to the tRPC architecture, all requests follow a consistent format:

<CodeGroup>
```json Request Structure
{
  "0": {
    "json": {
      // Request specific parameters
      "data": {},
      "where": {},
      "include": {}
    }
  }
}
```

```json Response Structure
[
  {
    "result": {
      "data": {
        "json": {
          // Response data
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common Patterns

### Batching Requests

tRPC allows batching multiple requests together for better performance:

```bash
https://app.tryiris.dev/api/trpc/[procedure1],[procedure2]?batch=1
```

### Including Related Data

Many endpoints support an `include` parameter to fetch related data:

```json
{
  "include": {
    "testRuns": {
      "orderBy": {
        "createdAt": "desc"
      },
      "take": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering and Searching

Use `where` clauses for filtering:

```json
{
  "where": {
    "name": {
      "contains": "search-term",
      "mode": "insensitive"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

<ResponseField name="401" type="object">
  Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API token
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="404" type="object">
  Resource not found
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="500" type="object">
  Internal server error
</ResponseField>

## Type Safety

<Tip>
Our API is built with tRPC, ensuring complete type safety from your API calls to your database. When our TypeScript SDK is released, you'll get:

- Full autocompletion
- Runtime type checking
- Compile-time type checking
- Automatic type inference
</Tip>

## Available Endpoints

Our API is organized into several main categories:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tests" icon="vial" href="/api-reference/tests/create">
    Create and manage automated tests. Includes endpoints for [creating](/api-reference/tests/create), [listing](/api-reference/tests/list), [updating](/api-reference/tests/update), and [deleting](/api-reference/tests/delete) tests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot" href="/api-reference/agents/create">
    Configure AI testing agents. Access endpoints for [creating](/api-reference/agents/create), [getting](/api-reference/agents/get), and [deleting](/api-reference/agents/delete) agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Projects" icon="folder" href="/api-reference/projects/create">
    Organize tests into projects. Use endpoints to [create](/api-reference/projects/create) and [delete](/api-reference/projects/delete) projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organizations" icon="building" href="/api-reference/organizations/create">
    Manage team access and settings. Includes organization management endpoints.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Even if an endpoint isn't explicitly documented, it likely exists and follows the same patterns described above. This is because our tRPC backend automatically exposes procedures in a consistent way.

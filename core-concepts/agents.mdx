## Overview

AI Agents are the core of Iris QA's autonomous testing capabilities. These agents use advanced language models to understand, interact with, and test your user interfaces intelligently.

## Supported AI Models

## Agent Capabilities

### 1. UI Understanding
- Natural language processing of UI elements
- Context-aware interaction with components
- Dynamic element identification

### 2. Test Generation
- Automatic test case creation
- Scenario identification
- Edge case detection

### 3. Self-Healing
- Adaptive element location
- UI change detection
- Automatic test maintenance

## Creating an Agent

To create an agent, you'll need to:

1. Choose an AI model provider
2. Configure authentication
3. Set up agent parameters
4. Define testing scope

For detailed API information, see the [Agent API Reference](/api-reference/agents/create).

## Best Practices

  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Model Selection">
    Choose your AI model based on your specific testing needs:
    - Vertex AI for complex UI understanding
    - Bedrock for multi-model flexibility
    - Claude for advanced reasoning tasks
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configuration">
    Optimize your agent's performance by:
    - Setting appropriate timeout values
    - Configuring retry mechanisms
    - Defining clear test boundaries
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Security">
    Ensure secure agent operation by:
    - Using environment variables for credentials
    - Implementing proper access controls
    - Regular security audits

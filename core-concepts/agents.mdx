# Agents

Agents are the fundamental building blocks of Iris's testing capabilities. They are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and equipped with specialized tools that enable them to interact with web applications just like human users would.

## What are Iris Agents?

Iris agents are AI-powered entities that combine:
- Advanced language understanding capabilities
- Visual processing abilities
- Web navigation tools
- Testing automation capabilities

## Key Features

### Multi-Modal Capabilities
- **Visual Understanding**: Agents can process and understand website layouts, UI elements, and visual content
- **Text Processing**: Comprehend textual content, error messages, and documentation
- **Interactive Navigation**: Ability to click, type, scroll, and perform complex user interactions

### Autonomous Operation
- **Self-Guided Testing**: Agents can autonomously explore and test websites
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Make contextual decisions based on application state
- **Error Detection**: Identify and report issues during testing

### Tool Integration
- **Built-in Tools**: Come equipped with various testing and navigation tools
- **Customizable Actions**: Can be configured for specific testing scenarios
- **Reporting Capabilities**: Generate detailed test reports and user journey graphs

## Creating an Agent

To create an agent, you'll need to:
1. Define the agent's purpose and scope
2. Configure its permissions and capabilities
3. Set up testing parameters
4. Specify autonomous mode settings if required

## Best Practices

- Start with clearly defined test objectives
- Configure appropriate permission levels
- Monitor agent activities during initial runs
- Regularly update agent configurations based on testing needs

## Use Cases

1. **Automated Testing**
   - End-to-end testing
   - User journey validation
   - Regression testing

2. **User Experience Analysis**
   - Navigation flow assessment
   - UI/UX evaluation
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Documentation Verification**
   - Content accuracy checking
   - Link validation
   - Cross-reference verification

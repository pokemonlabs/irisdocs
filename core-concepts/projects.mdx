# Projects

Projects in Iris represent individual applications or websites that need to be tested. They serve as organizational units that group related tests, agents, and test runs together.

## Understanding Projects

A project in Iris typically represents:
- A single web application
- A collection of related web services
- A specific testing environment
- A distinct testing initiative

## Project Structure

### Components
- **Tests**: Collection of all test cases for the application
- **Agents**: Associated LLM agents configured for testing
- **Test Runs**: Historical record of all test executions
- **Settings**: Project-specific configurations

## Project Management

### Creation and Setup
1. Define project details
2. Configure testing environment
3. Set up access permissions
4. Add team members (if applicable)

### Organization
- **Logical Grouping**: Keep related tests together
- **Environment Separation**: Maintain different projects for development, staging, and production
- **Version Control**: Track changes and updates to tests

## Project Settings

### Configuration Options
- Test environment URLs
- Default agent settings
- Notification preferences
- Integration settings

### Access Control
- User roles and permissions
- API key management
- Authentication settings

## Best Practices

1. **Project Structure**
   - Use clear, descriptive project names
   - Maintain organized test hierarchies
   - Document project specifications

2. **Management**
   - Regular project audits
   - Clean up unused resources
   - Keep configurations updated

3. **Collaboration**
   - Share project access appropriately
   - Maintain testing documentation
   - Set up proper notification channels

## Use Cases

### Single Application Testing
- Complete end-to-end testing suite
- Regression testing setup
- Performance monitoring

### Multi-Environment Testing
- Development environment checks
- Staging environment validation
- Production monitoring

### Team Collaboration
- Shared test resources
- Coordinated test execution
- Centralized result tracking

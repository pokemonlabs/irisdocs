# Test Runs

Test runs represent individual executions of tests by Iris agents. Each test run captures the complete journey of a test, including interactions, validations, and results.

## Understanding Test Runs

A test run includes:
- Complete execution history
- Agent interactions and decisions
- Screenshots and recordings
- Performance metrics
- Test results and outcomes

## Test Run Lifecycle

### 1. Initialization
- Agent preparation
- Environment setup
- Resource allocation
- Configuration loading

### 2. Execution
- Step-by-step progression
- Real-time monitoring
- Error handling
- State management

### 3. Completion
- Result compilation
- Resource cleanup
- Report generation
- Notification dispatch

## Test Run Data

### Captured Information
- Execution timestamps
- Agent actions
- System responses
- Visual evidence
- Performance metrics
- Error logs

### Analytics
- Success/failure status
- Execution duration
- Resource usage
- Error patterns
- Coverage metrics

## Real-time Monitoring

### Available Features
- Live progress tracking
- Agent activity monitoring
- Error detection
- Performance analysis

### Intervention Options
- Pause execution
- Manual override
